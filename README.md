# Snake-Game-Assembly-x88
The Snake Game project in 8088 assembly language is a classic implementation where players control a snake using arrow keys to eat food and grow while avoiding walls and collisions with itself. Key features include movement control via keyboard interrupts, collision detection, score tracking, and real-time screen rendering using a buffer.
